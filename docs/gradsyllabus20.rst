Course Purpose
--------------

The students completing this course will be able to apply standard
numerical solution techniques to problems in Oceanographic, Atmospheric
and Earth Science.

Instructors
-----------

| Rachel White, rwhite@eoas.ubc.ca, Rm 4019 ESB
| Susan Allen, 2-2828, sallen@eoas.ubc.ca, Rm 3017 ESB

Prerequisites
-------------

The course assumes a mathematics background including vector calculus
and linear algebra. Students weak in either of these areas will be
directed to readings to strengthen their knowledge. Some programming
experience is greatly recommended.

Course Structure
----------------

This course is not lecture based. The course is an interactive, computer
based laboratory course. The computer will lead you through the
laboratory (like a set of lab notes) and you will answer problems most
of which use the computer. The course consists of three parts. A set of
required interactive, computer based laboratory exercises, a choice of
optional laboratory exercises and a project. The project will be
determined through consultation between the student and their
supervisor.

During the meeting times, we will have brief presentations to help with
technical matters and the more difficult sections of the course. It is
highly recommended that you join us to work on the course during the
meeting times. Past students who did so got a great deal more out of the
course than those that worked on their own.

Meeting Times
-------------

1400-1600 Mondays, Room 135, Earth and Oceans Sciences (EOS) Main

Grades
------

- High Project

  -  Laboratory Exercises 35%
  -  Quizzes 5%
  -  Project Proposal 10%
  -  Project 40%
  -  Project Oral Presentation 10%


Laboratory Problem Sets
-----------------------

The laboratory problem sets can be given to either instructor when
completed. (We have mail boxes in the Earth and Ocean Sciences Main
Office). They may be hand written or typed. You may wish or be asked to
include plots and diagrams. Sometimes, rather than a large series of
plots, you may wish to include a summarizing table. If you do not
understand the scope of a problem, please ask. The time scales given in
the Contents section are based on 9 hours/week. Help with the labs is
available 1) through piazza on Connect so you can contact your classmates
and ask them 2) during the weekly scheduled lab or 3) directly from the
instructors. Assignments and the project are expected on time. Late ones
will be marked and then the mark will be multiplied by
:math:`(0.9)^{\rm (number\ of\ days\ or\ part\ days\ late)}`. (Below we
give two dates for each assignment. You should aim for the first one
(this would keep you totally up to date). The later one allows a couple
of days “in case”.)
