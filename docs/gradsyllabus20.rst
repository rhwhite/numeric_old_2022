Course Purpose
--------------

The students completing this course will be able to apply standard
numerical solution techniques to problems in Oceanographic, Atmospheric
and Earth Science.

Instructors
-----------

| Rachel White, rwhite@eoas.ubc.ca, Rm 4019 ESB
| Susan Allen, 2-2828, sallen@eoas.ubc.ca, Rm 3017 ESB

Prerequisites
-------------

The course assumes a mathematics background including vector calculus
and linear algebra. Students weak in either of these areas will be
directed to readings to strengthen their knowledge. Programming
experience is greatly recommended.

Course Structure
----------------

This course is not lecture based. The course is an interactive, computer
based laboratory course. The computer will lead you through the
laboratory (like a set of lab notes) and you will answer problems most
of which use the computer. The course consists of three parts. A set of
required interactive, computer based laboratory exercises, a choice of
optional laboratory exercises and a project. The project will be a
group project
determined through consultation between the instructors, the student and their
supervisors.

During the meeting times, there will be group worksheets to delve
into the material, brief presentations to help with technical
matters, time to ask questions in a group format and also individually
and time to read and work on the laboratories.

You can use a web-browser to examine the course exercises. Point your

Meeting Times
-------------

1400-1600 Mondays, Room 127, Earth and Oceans Sciences (EOS) Main

Grades
------

  -  Laboratory Exercises 30% (individual with collaboration)
  -  Quizzes 5% (individual)
  -  Worksheets 5% (group)
  -  Project Proposal 10% (group)
  -  Project 40% (group)
  -  Project Oral Presentation 10% (group)

For each computer laboratory there will be an assigned exercise set.
Note that these are not necessarily the same as the problems in the
lab and will generally be a much smaller set.  Laboratory exercises
can be worked with partners or alone. Each student must upload their
own solution in their own words.

Quizzes are done online, reflect the learning objectives of each lab
and are assigned to ensure you do the reading with enough depth to
participate fully in the class worksheets and have the background to
do the Laboratory Exercises.   There will be a "grace space" policy
allowing you to miss one quiz.

The in-class worksheets will be marked for a complete effort. There
will be a “grace space” policy allowing you to miss one class
worksheet. The grace space policy is to accommodate missed classes due
to illness, “away games” for athletes etc. In-class paper worksheets
are done as a group and are to handed in (one worksheet only per
group) at the end of the worksheet time.

The project will be done in groups of three to four. It is to be chosen in consultation with your research supervisors and the
   instructors.

The laboratory problem sets are to be uploaded to the course CANVAS page. Sometimes, rather than a large series of plots, you may wish to
include a summarizing table. If you do not understand the scope of a
problem, please ask. Help with the labs is
available 1) through piazza (see CANVAS) so you can contact your classmates
and ask them 2) during the weekly scheduled lab or 3) directly from the
instructors. Assignments, quizzes, mini-projects and the project are expected on
time. Late ones will be marked and then the mark will be multiplied by
:math:`(0.9)^{\rm (number\ of\ days\ or\ part\ days\ late)}`. (Below we
give two dates for each assignment. You should aim for the first one
(this would keep you totally up to date). The later one allows a couple
of days in case. )

University Statement on Values and Policies
----------------------------------

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain
healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so
there are additional resources to access including those for survivors
of sex- ual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of
all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination
are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides
appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for
religious and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and
students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and
to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their
actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are
available here

Supporting Diversity and Inclusions
----------------------------

Atmospheric Science, Oceanography and the Earth Sciences havebeen
historically dominated by a small subset of
privileged people who are predominantly male and white, missing out on
many influential individuals thoughts and
experiences. In this course, we would like to create an environment
that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives
and experiences, and honours your identities. To help accomplish this:

  - Please let us know your preferred name and/or set of pronouns.
  - If you feel like your performance in our class is impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you and to help you succeed.
  - If an approach in class does not work well for you, please talk to any of the teaching team and we will do our best to make adjustments. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated.
  - We are all still learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it


Academic Integrity
---------------

Students are expected to learn material with honesty, integrity, and responsibility.
  - Honesty means you should not take credit for the work of others, and if you work with others you are
careful to give them the credit they deserve.
  - Integrity means you follow the rules you are given and are respectful towards others and their attempts
to do so as well.
  - Responsibility means that you if you are unclear about the rules in a specific case you should contact
the instructor for guidance.

The course will involve a mixture of individual and group work. We try
to be flexible about this as my priority is for you to learn the
material rather than blindly follow rules, but there are
rules. Plagiarism (i.e. copying of others work) and cheating (not
following the rules) can result in penalties ranging from zero on an
assignment to failing the course.


COVID Safety in the Classroom
------------------------

The first two classes, January 10 and January 17, will be held on
zoom.  Details to follow.

If we return to the classroom on January 24, we will add a COVID
safety statement here.


**For due dates etc, please see the Detailed Schedule.**
