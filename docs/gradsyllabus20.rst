Course Purpose
--------------

The students completing this course will be able to apply standard
numerical solution techniques to problems in Oceanographic, Atmospheric
and Earth Science.

Instructors
-----------

| Rachel White, rwhite@eoas.ubc.ca, Rm 4019 ESB
| Susan Allen, 2-2828, sallen@eoas.ubc.ca, Rm 3017 ESB

Prerequisites
-------------

The course assumes a mathematics background including vector calculus
and linear algebra. Students weak in either of these areas will be
directed to readings to strengthen their knowledge. Programming
experience is greatly recommended.

Course Structure
----------------

This course is not lecture based. The course is an interactive, computer
based laboratory course. The computer will lead you through the
laboratory (like a set of lab notes) and you will answer problems most
of which use the computer. The course consists of three parts. A set of
required interactive, computer based laboratory exercises, a choice of
optional laboratory exercises and a project. The project will be a
group project
determined through consultation between the instructors, the student and their
supervisors.

During the meeting times, there will be group worksheets to delve
into the material, brief presentations to help with technical
matters, time to ask questions in a group format and also individually
and time to read and work on the laboratories.

You can use a web-browser to examine the course exercises. Point your

Meeting Times
-------------

1400-1600 Mondays, Room 127, Earth and Oceans Sciences (EOS) Main

Grades
------

  -  Laboratory Exercises 30%
  -  Quizzes 5%
  -  Worksheets 5%
  -  Project Proposal 10%
  -  Project 40%
  -  Project Oral Presentation 10%


Laboratory Problem Sets
-----------------------

The laboratory problem sets are to be uploaded to the course CANVAS page. Sometimes, rather than a large series of plots, you may wish to
include a summarizing table. If you do not understand the scope of a
problem, please ask. Help with the labs is
available 1) through piazza (see CANVAS) so you can contact your classmates
and ask them 2) during the weekly scheduled lab or 3) directly from the
instructors. Assignments, quizzes, mini-projects and the project are expected on
time. Late ones will be marked and then the mark will be multiplied by
:math:`(0.9)^{\rm (number\ of\ days\ or\ part\ days\ late)}`. (Below we
give two dates for each assignment. You should aim for the first one
(this would keep you totally up to date). The later one allows a couple
of days in case. )
